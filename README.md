Terraform Leaseweb Provider
---------------------------

A Terraform provider to manage Leaseweb resources.


Requirements
------------

Terraform 0.12.0 or later is needed to use this plugin.

Go 1.18 or later is needed to build the plugin.


Setup for development
---------------------

This setup uses docker so you do not need go (or any of the build tools) on
your workstation.
1. You need `docker` and `docker compose`.
2. Git clone this repository and `cd` into it.
3. Run `docker compose build`
4. Run `docker compose up -d`


Building the plugin
-------------------

To build the plugin (in docker):

    docker compose exec --env GOOS=$GOOS --env GOARCH=$GOARCH backend go build -o terraform-provider-leaseweb


Using the plugin locally
------------------------

Move the plugin into the `~/.terraform.d/plugins/terraform.local/local/leaseweb/$VERSION/$GOOS_$GOARCH/` directory.

It can then be used the following way in your config:

    terraform {
      required_providers {
        leaseweb = {
          source = "terraform.local/local/leaseweb"
          version = "0.3.1"
        }
      }
    }


Building the plugin using a local checkout of the Leaseweb Golang SDK
---------------------------------------------------------------------

If you need to do a modification in the SDK and want to test it within the usage of the plugin,
add the following at the end of the go.mod file to point to your local SDK checkout

    replace github.com/LeaseWeb/leaseweb-go-sdk => /home/.../leaseweb-go-sdk
