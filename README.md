# Terraform Leaseweb Provider

[![Go Reference](https://pkg.go.dev/badge/github.com/leaseweb/terraform-provider-leaseweb.svg)](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/leaseweb/terraform-provider-leaseweb)

A Terraform provider to manage Leaseweb resources.

## Requirements

- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) >= 1.7
- [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install) >= 1.23
- [Node](https://nodejs.org) >= 20.17
- [pnPM](https://pnpm.io/) >= 9.7

All requirements are also satisfied by the included [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

## Building The Provider

1. Clone the repository
2. Enter the repository directory
3. Build the provider using the Go `install` command:

```shell
go install
```

## Adding Dependencies

This provider uses [Go modules](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules).
Please see the Go documentation for the most up-to-date information about using Go modules.

To add a new dependency `github.com/author/dependency` to your Terraform provider:

```shell
go get github.com/author/dependency
go mod tidy
```

Then commit the changes to `go.mod` and `go.sum`.

## Developing the Provider

If you wish to work on the provider, you'll first need [Go](http://www.golang.org) installed on your machine (see [Requirements](#requirements) above).

To compile the provider, run `go install`. This will build the provider and put the provider binary in the `$GOPATH/bin` directory.

To generate or update documentation, run `make generate`.

To run the full suite of Acceptance tests, run `make testacc`.

_Note:_ Acceptance tests create real resources, and often cost money to run.

```shell
make testacc
```

## Run mock server

To test against API specifications, a mock server can be run

```shell
docker-compose up -d
```

Make sure to use `localhost` in your requests as caddy does not know what to do with `127.0.0.1`

```shell

curl -i http://localhost:8080/publicCloud/v1/instances --header 'x-lsw-auth: tralala'
```

## First steps

To install relevant git hooks run

```bash
pnpm i
```

### Commits

All commits must adhere to the [conventional commit spec](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).
For the acceptance tests to run properly make sure to run ```docker-compose up -d```
before committing anything or the commit will fail.

### API Stability

Given that the public cloud API is currently in its beta version, we are maintaining the Terraform plugin in beta as well, despite the stability of our Dedicated Server API.

## Architecture

Code architecture is discussed in [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).
