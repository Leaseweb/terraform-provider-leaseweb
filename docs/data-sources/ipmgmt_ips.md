## Schema

### Optional

- `assigned_contract_ids` (List of String) Return only IPs assigned to contracts with these IDs
- `equipment_ids` (List of String) Return only IPs assigned to equipment items
- `filtered_ips` (List of String) Return only these IPs
- `from_ip` (String) Return only IPs greater or equal to the specified address
- `null_routed` (Boolean) Filter by whether the IP has an active null route
- `primary` (Boolean) Filter by whether or not the IP is primary
- `reverse_lookup` (String) Filter by reverse lookup
- `sort` (List of String) Sort field names. Prepend the field name with '-' for descending order. E.g. `ip,-nullrouted`. Sortable field names are `ip`, `nullRouted`, `reverseLookup`
- `subnet_id` (String) Filter by subnet
- `to_ip` (String) Return only IPs lower or equal to the specified address
- `type` (String) Filter by IP type. Valid options are 
  - *NORMAL_IP*
  - *NETWORK*
  - *BROADCAST*
  - *GATEWAY*
  - *ROUTER1*
  - *ROUTER2*
  - *IPMI*
- `version` (Number) Filter by protocol version. Valid options are
