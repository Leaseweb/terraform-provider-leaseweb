# {{ .RenderedProviderName }} Provider

The {{ .RenderedProviderName }} provider is used to interact with the many
resources supported by Leaseweb. The provider needs to be configured with the
proper credentials before it can be used.

## Example Usage

{{ tffile "examples/provider/provider.tf" }}

{{ .SchemaMarkdown | trimspace }}

## Multiple accounts

The token necessary for the configuration of the provider is linked to a
particular account. In case you want to manage within a single configuration
resources from different accounts, you'll need to use aliases and the
[provider meta-argument](https://www.terraform.io/language/meta-arguments/resource-provider)
in your resources.

{{ tffile "examples/provider/multiple_providers.tf" }}

The token are hardcoded in this example for simplicity, you should use
[input variables](https://www.terraform.io/language/values/variables) instead.
